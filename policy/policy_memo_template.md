# Policy Memo — EBAN Budget Guardian
**Author:**  
**Date:**  

## 1) Issue
Student budgeting tools may trigger overdrafts via faulty advice.

## 2) Stakeholders
Students, universities, banks, developers, regulators.

## 3) Risk & Ethics (FATE)
- **Fairness:** ensure equal performance across subgroups; report metrics.
- **Accountability:** named owners; incident response + audit trail.
- **Transparency:** advisory-only labels; user-facing explanations/tooltips.
- **Explainability:** show calculation for each recommendation.

## 4) Recommendations
- Advisory-only label & disclaimers.
- Default overdraft safeguards for student accounts.
- Independent audit at launch + annually.
- Short in-app micro-learnings before first use.
- Opt-in data collection with clear purpose; no dark patterns.

## 5) Implementation & Cost
Phased rollout; estimate eng + compliance hours; who pays.

## 6) Evaluation
KPIs: overdraft rate, complaint rate, completion of micro-learnings, subgroup parity.

## 7) Appendix
Model card, DPIA checklist, data schema.
